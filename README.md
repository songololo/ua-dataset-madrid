# Madrid Dataset

Madrid Dataset and downstream urban analytics dataset based on Madrid open data.

## Installation

Clone this repository to a local working folder.

A python package manager and an IDE such as `vscode` are recommended.

### UV

The UV package manager can be installed on mac per `brew install uv`. Packages can then be installed into a virtual environment per `uv sync`.

### PDM

The PDM package manager can be installed on mac per `brew install pdm`. Packages can then be installed into a virtual environment per `pdm install`.

### IDE and venv

The virtual environment should be detected automatically by IDEs such as vscode, else activate it manually.

### Setup

Create a `temp` folder inside the repository's root folder. This folder is ignored by `.gitignore` but is necessary for the script to output files from the processing steps.

The code is in `process/compute.py` file and can be run using code cells demarcated by the `# %%` lines (assuming an IDE such as vscode). Else these can be copied and pasted into a Python Notebook.

The file can otherwise be run directly, though the file paths to the `data` folder may need to be adjusted (e.g. changing `../` to `./`).

## Data Sources

### Madrid Data

The data sources are pre-processed as described below and saved to the `data` sub-folder in this repository so that the datasets and results can be reproduced in downstream research.
